Visual Analysis for Kobe, MJ, and Lebron Statistics

A constant debate amongst NBA fans is who is ‘better’ at basketball, Michael Jordan? Kobe
Bryant? Or Lebron James? Being a huge basketball fan myself, and not particularly bias towards
any of these players, I wanted to compare their stats for regular season games and playoffs to
observe any outliers or a clear objective truth as to who is the better player. I want to use the
seaborn library to have helpful visuals on the underlying statistics. In the future, any new upcoming "GOATS" can be compared to the 3 we’re analyzing today to see if they fit in the molds of LBJ,
Kobe, or MJ; or if they’re in a league all on their own.
